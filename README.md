# weather_app

Summary: Created a weather app using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Used Open Weather Map API key. 

How to: A user inputs any city in the world and the app will return the city's current temperature, wind speed and humidity percentage. It will also show an icon of the current conditions (sunny, snow, etc). If the user types in a city that doesn't exit, then an error code will be shown.
